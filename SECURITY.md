# Security

This document provides information on how to report security issues and what steps we take to ensure the security of RemDep. 

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability or issue, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **Do Not Open Public Issues**: For security reasons, do not open a public issue on GitHub. Instead, contact us directly to report the issue.
2. **Email Us**: Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to [security@remdep.com](mailto:nikolamatic225@gmail.com). Include as much information as possible, such as:
   - The nature of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any potential impact
   - Your contact information (optional but helpful for follow-up)

3. **Wait for a Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours. We will work to address the issue and keep you updated on the progress.

4. **Disclosure**: After the issue has been resolved, we will coordinate with you to ensure proper disclosure. We will provide details on how the issue was fixed and how it may impact users.

## Security Best Practices

To help ensure the security of the RemDep project, we follow these best practices:

- **Regular Updates**: We keep dependencies and software up to date to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Code Reviews**: We perform code reviews to identify and address potential security issues before code is merged.
- **Testing**: We use automated tests and security scanning tools to detect issues early.
- **Community Involvement**: We encourage the community to report any potential security issues and to follow best practices when contributing.

## Security Patches

When a security vulnerability is reported, we will:

1. **Assess the Issue**: Evaluate the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
2. **Develop a Fix**: Implement a patch or workaround to address the issue.
3. **Release an Update**: Publish a new version of RemDep with the fix and provide release notes detailing the changes.
4. **Communicate**: Inform users of the update and encourage them to upgrade to the latest version.
