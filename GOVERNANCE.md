# Governance

This document outlines the governance structure and decision-making processes for RemDep. It is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and community involvement in the development of the project.

## Project Maintainers

The project is overseen by a team of maintainers who are responsible for making key decisions, reviewing contributions, and guiding the overall direction of the project. The current maintainers are:

- **[SwyftPain](https://github.com/SwyftPain)** - [Lead Dev]

Maintainers are selected based on their contributions, expertise, and active involvement in the project. Decisions are made collaboratively among the maintainers, with a focus on consensus.

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions about the project are made through the following process:

1. **Proposals**: Contributors can propose changes or new features by opening an issue or a pull request. Proposals should include a clear description of the change, its benefits, and any potential impact on the project.
2. **Discussion**: Proposals are discussed by the maintainers and the community. Feedback is gathered to assess the viability and impact of the proposed changes.
3. **Approval**: Decisions are made based on consensus among the maintainers. In some cases, a vote may be conducted if consensus cannot be reached.
4. **Implementation**: Once a proposal is approved, it is implemented by the contributors or maintainers. The implementation is reviewed to ensure it meets the agreed-upon specifications.
5. **Monitoring**: After implementation, the change is monitored for any issues or feedback from the community.
